# Mithril CC

An opinionated pleasure on writing [Mithril.js](https://mithril.js.org) components.

## Motivation

Mithril is the leader and forerunner of declarative HTML views in plain old JavaScript. However, its flourishing flexibility can leave one uncertain on the "right" way to do certain things; the array of options available all have different pros and cons that depend on the type of component you're writing.

Mithril CC aims to compress these options into a pleasant, one-size-fits-all approach, trading tedious decision fatigue for peace and tranquility.

## Getting Started

```bash
yarn add mithril-cc
# or
npm install mithril-cc
```
